Problem A
The problem reduces to the following: Given a polygon on the plane (in clockwise order) find the closest and furthest point
To find the furthest is quite easy, we know that it has to be a vertex.
To find the closest point the problem changes, it might lie on a segment, although it can still easily be solved with a binary search, or with some calculations
