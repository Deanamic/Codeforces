- [x] Problem A  

- [x] Problem B  

- [x] Problem C  

The minimum possible is playing against some one with n-2, and then with someone with n-1 ==> fibonacci.  

- [x] Problem D  
If n is prime, then we will only pay 1 burle. By goldbachs conjecture any even composite can be expressed as the sum of 2 prime numbers.
Lastly if n is odd we can first make it even and apply goldbach. Be aware that a number can also be prime + 2.  

- [ ] Problem E
